## To create a new column that's a multiple of two columns

Columnname= table1name[columnname]* table2name[columnname ] 

Example
> salesamount= products[unitprice]* products[quantityordered]


## It is possible to create a new column from two seperate tables/datasets related by a unique column shared by both tables.

To achieve this first of all under the Power Pivot pane an existing relationship between the two tables must be existing.

Proceeding, we use a similar syntax to the previous but we enclose the second table in this syntax**Related()**

>salesamount= products[unitprice]*Related([products[quantityordered])


## Appending datasets 

Similar to SQL we can merge two or more datasets together. In SQL, the syntax would be UNION.

And just like with the UNION syntax similar rules of a merge carry over. The two datasets being merged must have the same structure ie. same column names and same number of columns.
