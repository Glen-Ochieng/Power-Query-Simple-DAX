## To create a new column that's a multiple of two columns

Columnname= table1name[columnname]* table2name[columnname ] 

Example
> salesamount= products[unitprice]* products[quantityordered]


## It is possible to create a new column from two seperate tables/datasets related by a unique column shared by both tables.

To achieve this first of all under the Power Pivot pane an existing relationship between the two tables must be existing.

Proceeding, we use a similar syntax to the previous but we enclose the second table in this syntax**Related()**

>salesamount= products[unitprice]*Related([products[quantityordered])


## Appending datasets 

Similar to SQL we can merge two or more datasets together. In SQL, the syntax would be UNION.

And just like with the UNION syntax similar rules of a merge carry over. The two datasets being merged must have the same structure ie. same column names and same number of columns.

<ins>Example
Merge the top categories of movies from the following website: 

https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW

<b> Step 1 

Upload the datasets from the web using the URL from each categrories of the top shows starting with the top 200 of all time.

Use the New Source pane to quickly add the other datasets

<b> Step 2 

Set the first dataset as a reference. And it will be picked up as the dataset the others will be joined to.
Do this by right-clicking the dataset and clicking reference

After the dataset has been set as a reference, it will be added as a duplicate dataset at the bottom of the page. It is wise to rename it ; in this case it will be renamed Top Sales.

<b> Step 3 

Click the Append Option in the Home Page of Power Query

Select the other datasets and perform the append.


## Triming Rows by Character Size 

This is a simple task done by the Extract pane under the Transform Tab
